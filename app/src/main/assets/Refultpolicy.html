                <h3> REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICY </h3>
            <strong>PAY PANDA PAYMENT SOLUTION PRIVATE LIMITED </strong>is engaged in the business of providing
                payment solutions, financial solutions and other allied financial services on the basis of its
                engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a value is debited from your payment instrument/bank account and you have received the
                same value in your id, there is no cancellation or refund permitted for such transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, if in a transaction performed by you on the PAY PANDA Platform, money has been
                charged to your card or bank account and a value is not delivered within 24 - 96 hours of the
                completion of the transaction, then you shall inform us by sending an e-mail to our customer
                service e-mail address mentioned on the ‘Contact Us’ page on the PAY PANDA Platform. Please
                include the following details – value, transaction date and order number.
            </p>
            <p>
                PAY PANDA will investigate the incident and, if it is found that money was indeed charged to
                Your card or bank account without delivery of the value, then you will be refunded the money
                within 45 working days from the date of receipt of your e-mail.
            </p>
            <p>
                All refunds will be credited to the instrument that was charged.
            </p>
            <p>
                We thank you for transacting with us and look forward to a bright and successful future for our
                partnership.
            </p>
