            <h6>Cookies</h6>
            <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Pay Panda uses cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. No personal information will be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on the User’s desktop/laptop/mobile device's memory drive. Once the User agrees, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic. Cookies allow Services to respond to the User as an individual. The Services can tailor its operations to the User’s needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about the User’s preferences.</p>
            <p>
                We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our Services in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

            Overall, cookies help us provide Users with a better experience of the Services, by enabling us to monitor which pages Users find useful and which the Users do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to the User’s desktop/laptop/mobile device or any information about the User, other than the data a User chooses to share with us.
        </p>

                A User can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but a User can usually modify its browser setting to decline cookies if the user prefers. This may prevent the User from taking full advantage of the Services.

                What is a Cookie?

                A cookie is a small file, or files on your computer, phone, or other device with a browser to save snippets of text for reference by the website you are visiting. All cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser:

                Session cookies - these are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you close your browser.

                Persistent cookies - these usually have an expiration date and so stay in your browser until they expire, or until you manually delete them. For example we use persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.

                Cookies are grouped into the following categories:

                Essential - these are cookies that are required for the regular operation of our websites.

                Functional - these remember your preferences, and are intended to make your experience on our websites better for you.

                Analytics – these cookies are used for performance measurement to understand things including how many people visit our websites, how they navigate our sites, and what content is popular. This allows us to improve your experience with us. Additionally, you can see how Google Analytics (one of our analytics tools) uses cookie information when you use our partners' sites by visiting www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time

                Advertising - these cookies enable us and our advertising partners to serve you with relevant advertisements that we think will interest you. You might see these advertisements on our sites on other sites you visit. These cookies record your visit to our website and the content you interact with. They may be placed by us, or by advertising partners with our permission.

                To ensure compliance with our policies, we restrict the use of third-party cookies to trusted partners.

                We also use third party information from third party sources to enable us deliver advertising. These sources are validated by Third party, and not by us.

                To delete cookies from your browser, please note the following simple steps. The following steps are indicative for Google chrome and might vary of the different browsers that you may use. Please refer Settings on your browser for further details.
